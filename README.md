# Location-based Notifications in Flutter

This Flutter project allows users to receive notifications when they enter or exit a specific location radius. The application utilizes geofencing and push notifications to provide users with timely updates based on their location.

## Features

- **Geofencing**: Defines virtual boundaries around a geographical location to trigger notifications when the user enters or exits those boundaries.
- **Push Notifications**: Sends notifications to the user's device when geofence events occur.
- **Customizable Radius**: Allows users to set the radius of the geofence area according to their preferences.
- **Background Execution**: Continuously monitors the user's location, even when the app is running in the background, to provide timely notifications.
